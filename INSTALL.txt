Install
*******

This install process, explain how to install Anuket and how to quicky test it
in an isolated environemnt.

Prerequistes
============
Anuket need Python 2.7 to work. It is not tested yet for Python 3 but we are
planing to do so.

Anuket need the following Python packages to work :

* pyramid
* SQLAlchemy
* pyramid_beaker
* pyramid_debugtoolbar
* pyramid_exclog
* pyramid_simpleform
* pyramid_tm
* alembic
* Babel
* formencode
* cracklib
* cryptacular
* Mako

You can install Python and the packages prerequistes with your OS package
manager, from PyPI or directly from source.

If you have decided to use PyPI, the prerequists would be installed
automaticaly when you install Anuket.


Install with testing purpose
============================

If you just want to play with Anuket and quicky see whats he offer then follow
this steeps.


Prepare an isolated environment
-------------------------------

To avoid messing with your working Python applications, it is recommended to
test Anuket in an isolated environment.

    $ pip install virtualenv
    $ virtualenv anuketenv
    $ cd anuketenv
    $ source /bin/activate

Note: When you will have finish to play, you can get rid of Anuket by just
deleting the /anuketenv directory.


Install from PyPI
-----------------

You can simply install Anuket from PyPI by using pip or easy_install:

    (anuketenv)$ pip install anuket

or

    (anuketenv)$ easy_install anuket

This will install Anuket and all the necessary dependencies.


Alternaly, if you fell more risky you can install the last development version
directly from the the Git repository. But, please dont' forget than the
development version may not work perfectly!


    (anuketenv)$ git clone git@github.com:lazaret/anuket.git
    (anuketenv)$ cd anuket/
    (anuketenv)$ python setup.py develop


Initialize the database
-----------------------

Finaly you just need to create the default development database:

    (anuketenv)$ initialize_anuket_db development.ini

Start the testing server:

    (anuketenv)$ pserve development.ini

And connect to the application on http://0.0.0.0:6543 with the default admin
login and password: admin/admin.


Creating your application with Anuket
=====================================

Even if you can test it like explained above, Anuket is not realy intended to
be used alone. Anuket is a Pyramid based web framework, and it is intended to
be used by other pyramid aplication by just exenting it.
